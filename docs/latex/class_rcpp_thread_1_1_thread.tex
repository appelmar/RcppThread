R-\/friendly version of {\ttfamily std\+::thread}.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$Thread.\+hpp$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
R-\/friendly version of {\ttfamily std\+::thread}. 

Instances of class {\ttfamily \hyperlink{class_rcpp_thread_1_1_thread}{Thread}} behave just like instances of {\ttfamily std\+::thread}, see \href{http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread}{\tt http\+://en.\+cppreference.\+com/w/cpp/thread/thread} for methods and examples. There is one difference exception\+: Whenever other threads are doing some work, the master thread periodically synchronizes with R. When the user interrupts a threaded computation, any thread will stop as soon as it encounters a {\ttfamily \hyperlink{namespace_rcpp_thread_ade67c61ac7a988425ba74d9ac56b4327}{check\+User\+Interrupt()}}. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
Rcpp\+Thread/inst/include/\+Rcpp\+Thread/Thread.\+hpp\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
